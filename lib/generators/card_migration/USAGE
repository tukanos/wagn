DEPRECATED!!!

( this is only here for reference)

Description:
    Generates a migration of card type/content based on a list of cards from the template database (should be current development db)

Example:
    rails generate card_migration better_commented_search_cards /tmp/search_card_list.txt

    the tmp file should contain a list of card names, one name per line (and nothing else)

    This will create:
        db/migrate/(migration_number)_name

    ...which will in turn use methods in db/wagn_migration_helper to update cards via the migration.
