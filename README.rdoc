=Wagn: how pioneers roll

== Basics

Wagn is an open web platform for building coherent web systems.

Using simple wiki-inspired building blocks called cards, "Wagneers" construct sites ranging from simple content managers to custom project trackers to fully integrated web suites.  

==Dependencies
 
Ruby[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/]:: version 1.8.7 or higher
Bundler[http://gembundler.com/]:: version 1.0 or higher
ImageMagick[http://www.imagemagick.org/]::
git[http://git-scm.com/]::
A database engine:: Either MySQL[http://www.mysql.com/] or PostgreSQL[http://www.postgresql.org/]

=Installation

===1. Get the source

 git clone git://github.com/wagn/wagn.git
 cd wagn # remaining commands should be executed from this directory


===2. Get libraries (ruby gems)

 bundle install --without postgres:memcache:test:debug:development:assets:profile

The above is for a mysql installation.  If you want to use postgres, switch "postgres" to "mysql" on the without list.

Watch carefully for errors!  You may need to run as a admin user (using sudo, for example).  For more info see using bundler with Wagn.


===3. Configure
First, install needed config files with:

 rake wagn:install # production-only MySQL setup
 
For PostgreSQL setup, use `env ENGINE=postgres rake wagn:install` 
For developer setup, use `env MODE=dev rake wagn:install` 

Then, edit the config/database.yml file as necessary.  The default configuration works if you have password-less root access to mysql.   More about database configuration at http://www.wagn.org/database_configuration.


===4. Seed your data

 bundle exec rake wagn:create


===5. Start your server

To fire up the default, built-in WEBrick server, just run:

 env STATIC_ASSETS=true bundle exec rails server
 
...and point your browser to http://localhost:3000 (unless otherwise configured).

WEBrick is great for a quick test run.  To run a production website, see http://www.wagn.org/wagn_in_production.
